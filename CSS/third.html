        <p class="tp"><span class="text">Blockchain </span>is a decentralized, distributed digital ledger that records transactions
            across many computers so
            that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the
            consensus of the network.

            This technology uses cryptography to link blocks of data together, creating a secure and transparent chain
            of information. Blockchains are most commonly known for their use in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but they
            have potential applications in various industries, including finance, healthcare, supply chain management,
            and voting systems.</p>

        <p class="tp"><span class="text">Cybersecurity</span> is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data
            from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It involves a
            combination of technical measures, organizational policies, and security practices to safeguard sensitive
            information and ensure the integrity and availability of systems. Cybersecurity threats can range from
            malicious software (malware) and phishing attacks to more sophisticated techniques like ransomware and
            social engineering. Effective cybersecurity measures are essential to protect individuals, businesses, and
            governments from the potential consequences of cyberattacks.</p>

        <p class="tp"><span class="text">Graphic design</span> is the art and craft of creating visual communications, using
            typography, imagery, and layout to inform, persuade, or entertain. It encompasses a wide range of fields,
            including advertising, branding, print design, web design, and user interface design. Graphic designers use
            their skills to develop visual identities for brands, create marketing materials, design websites and apps,
            and produce printed materials like brochures, posters, and packaging. Effective graphic design combines
            aesthetic appeal with functionality, ensuring that the visual message is clear, engaging, and achieves its
            intended purpose.</p>
